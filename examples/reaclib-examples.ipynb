    "The ReacLib database draws from many sources, but part of its power and utility is that it imposes the same formalism on these sources.  That formalism, and indeed much of the ReacLib concept to my knowledge, is largely drawn from [Rausher & Thielemann 2000](https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0004059), a landmark publication in the field of nuclear astrophysics.  It focuses on the needs of astrophysical modelers, which often differ from those of nuclear theorists/modelers.  This formalism dates back, in part, to giants in the field like Fowler (such as [this](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1967ARA%26A...5..525F) from 1967).  Part of the formalism includes calculating and fitting rates in the form seen before:\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the \"rate\".  For convenience, it is calculated as this $\\lambda$ coefficient.  This is a reduced rate of sorts, and can have different units depending on the reaction type.  In a network of nuclear reaction ODEs, you'll have equations like the following for reactions of the form A+B-->C+D (this is from eqn. 2 in the 2010 reaclib paper):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "    -\\frac{1}{N_A}\\frac{dY_A}{dt} = -\\frac{1}{N_B}\\frac{dY_B}{dt}\n",

    "\n",
    "Here, $Y_I$ are molar abundances per gram of nuclide $I$, $N_I$ is the number of nuclides of $I$ produced or destroyed in the reaction, and $\\nu=N_A + N_B - 1$.  Part of the convenience of $\\lambda$ is that it can represent rates for many different types of reactions, which may have different units.  So for unary rates (e.g. a decay), $\\lambda = 1/\\tau$ is the inverse of the decay timescale with units of $\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.  We can see in this case, $\\nu=1+0-1=0$, so the density proportionality disappears, as expected for a unary rate.  For binary rates, $\\lambda=N_\\mathrm{Avogadro} \\langle \\sigma v \\rangle$ has units of $\\mathrm{cm}^3 \\mathrm{s}^{-1} \\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$, and trinary rates have $\\mathrm{cm}^6 \\mathrm{s}^{-1} \\mathrm{mol}^{-2}$ (and $\\nu=N_1+N_2+N_3-1=3-1=2$, so we obtain the expected $\\rho^2$ dependence).\n",
    "\n",
    "So that's a bit of context on $\\lambda$ and how it relates to calculting nuclear reaction rates.  At this point, astrophysicist diverge a bit from our purely nuclear colleagues.  We tend to be concerned with a \"target nucleus\", literally a target for their cool beams of things like protons to smash into.  This nucleus is just chilling, i.e. it's in the ground state.  Astrophysical nuclei don't usually get to chill, expecially if they're nuclei of interest to modelers.  Such nuclei tend to be participating in explosions with a background temperature that is not $T=0$.  One consequence is that it's possible a reaction is not proceeding on a ground-state target but on a target with potentially populated excited states.  [Fowler, Caughlan, and Zimmermann 1967](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1967ARA%26A...5..525F) provide a nice discussion of this and how it leads to the derivation of temperature-dependent partition functions\n",

    "where we sum over all the _relevant_ excited states $I^*$ of nuclide $I$.  A state is relevant if it lives longer than the reaction timescale.  See FCZ67 for details.  The point for us is that partition functions have a crucial utility in astrophysics: properly deriving inverse rates from known rates.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to derive an inverse rate $\\lambda_{C+D \\rightarrow A+B}$ from a known rate $\\lambda_{A+B \\rightarrow C+D}$, it is common to do so by assuming \"detailed balance,\" which means you're assuming the reaction with the known rate is in equilibrium with the reverse rate, thus the \"forward\" (known) rate _is_ simply the reverse rate with a flipped sign.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will be very unhappy if you do this in an astrophysical context and don't take into account potentially populated excited states participating in the reaction equilibrium.  If you look into the original sources/derivations, you'll find this comes out as multiplying by the ratio of partition functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "    \\lambda_{C+D \\rightarrow A+B} \\sim \\frac{G_{A}}{G_{D}} \\lambda_{A+B \\rightarrow C+D}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Technically, I believe $G_{A}$ should be something like $G_{A} G_{B}$ and similarly $G_D$ should be $G_C G_D$.  But in practice reactions are of the form A(b,c)D, where b and c are lighter things like protons, neutrons, helium, and even massless things like photons.  It makes some sense that these don't tend to have excited states participating in the equilibrium and can have their parition functions taken as 1.  The main point here is that to properly derive a rate from a known inverse rate, astrophysicists must account for these excited states as encoded by the temperature-dependent partition functions.  Rauscher and Thielemann 2000 provided partition functions for many isotopes, normalized to their ground state spin (so $g=1$ if there are no excited state contributions at the given T).  Due to this normalization, it's common for the rate calculation to multiply by ground state spin in the form $2j_{\\mathrm{gs},X}+1$, something like:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "    \\lambda_{C+D \\rightarrow A+B} \n",
    "    \\sim \\frac{(2j_{\\mathrm{gs},A}+1)g_{A}}{(2j_{\\mathrm{gs},D}+1)g_{D}} \\lambda_{A+B \\rightarrow C+D},\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where $g_{X}(T)$ are the ground-state-normalized partition functions.  So **your model calculations may need to know about ground-state spins**.  It's tricky.  Sometimes partition functions are provided with the spin information encoded, other times not.  Just be wary of this.  If $G=1$ at low $T$, then you probably need to multiply by $(2J_\\mathrm{gs}+1)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We now have enough background to understand how to treat the \"reverse\" flag in the ReacLib database.  We'll see this in practice in the next section."
